name: flyover
description: Turn a text description or an existing path into a cinematic 3D map flyover. Produces a GeoJSON list of camera waypoints and a self-contained HTML page that animates them with Mapbox GL JS, using the token in MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN. Use whenever the user asks for a flyover, fly-through, drone shot, aerial tour, orbit around a landmark, camera path, or animated map of a place, route, or region, or wants to fly along a GPS track, GPX, KML, or GeoJSON file, even if they never say "Mapbox" or "map". Also use when they want to tweak an existing flyover's speed, altitude, path, or mood.

# Flyover

You are the drone pilot and the editor. The user names a place, a route, or
a file with a track, and a mood. You choose the shot, write the waypoints,
build the page, and open it.

Output is two files next to each other, in the working directory unless the
user names another place:

- `<slug>.geojson`, the flight. Format in `references/waypoints.md`.
- `<slug>.html`, built from `assets/template.html` by `scripts/build.ts`.

The page is the map, the camera path, Space to pause, and one button that
records the flight to a video file. Nothing else. A title card, captions, a
progress bar, or controls are the user's call: offer them at the end, never
bake them in.

The page carries no token. It reads `access_token` from its URL and asks for
one when the URL has none. The style is Mapbox Standard with default options,
and terrain is whatever the style renders. The build prints the link.

## Workflow

1. Read the brief in this order, because each answer constrains the next:
   subject, then the one camera move, then speed, then mood. Decide as a
   pilot would instead of asking. Default length is 45 seconds.
2. Get coordinates. Use what you know for famous places. When unsure,
   geocode:

   ```bash
   curl -s "https://api.mapbox.com/search/geocode/v6/forward?q=Bethesda+Terrace+Central+Park&limit=1&access_token=$MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN" | node -e 'let s="";process.stdin.on("data",d=>s+=d).on("end",()=>console.log(JSON.parse(s).features[0].geometry.coordinates))'
   ```

   Geocoding returns wrong hits for small park features. Sanity-check every
   result against the coordinates you already know. Keep the token in the
   shell variable. The only place its value belongs is the link the build
   prints.
3. Design the shot and write `<slug>.geojson`. See "Designing the shot".
   When the path already exists as a file, see "Flying an existing path".
4. Build and read the report:

   ```bash
   node <skill-dir>/scripts/build.ts <slug>.geojson
   ```

   The script validates the flight, pins the latest stable Mapbox GL JS from
   `versions.json`, and prints one line per leg with speed, time, altitude,
   and turn angle, then warnings for hairpins, speed out of proportion to
   altitude, and buildings taller than the camera within 150 m of the path.
   You cannot watch the result, so this report is your slow-motion check.
   Fix every warning unless the brief asked for that exact thing, then
   rebuild. The last line is the link, token included.
5. Open the link: `open "<link>"`. If the page stays black, the browser is
   blocking tile workers on `file://`. Serve the folder instead with
   `python3 -m http.server 8765` and use the same query string.
6. Report the two paths and the link, describe the flight in two sentences,
   and say that editing the GeoJSON and rerunning the build changes the
   flight. Mention that the page's button downloads the flight as a video.
   Offer overlays as the follow-up if they would help. Skip the Artifact
   tool: the artifact sandbox blocks Mapbox requests, so the page renders
   black there.

## Designing the shot

### One move, done well

Name the move before placing a single waypoint. A flight with one clear
move reads as a film. A flight that tries three moves reads as a screensaver.

| Move | How | Good for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Orbit | `scripts/orbit.ts` around the subject, one altitude, every waypoint looks at it. Eight or more points, or it turns into a polygon. | A landmark, a stadium, a bridge. |
| Reveal | Start low and close behind a detail, rise and pull back until the whole subject is in frame. | A park, a campus, a district. |
| Tracking | Waypoints along a street, river, or ridge, no `lookAt`, so the camera looks ahead. | Routes, valleys, coastlines. |
| Approach | Start far and high, descend toward the subject, `hold` at the end. | An arrival, a hero shot. |
| Pass-by | Straight line past the subject, `lookAt` fixed on it, so it pans across the frame. | Skylines, waterfronts. |

Spend the boldness in one place. One long bearing sweep, one dive, or one
climb per flight. Everything around it stays quiet.

### Frame one

The viewer watches the first second more than any other. The page fades in
with the camera already at cruise speed, so the first waypoint carries the
whole opening:

- The subject is in frame and nothing stands between camera and target.
  Start over open ground: water, a park, a plaza, a wide avenue. Over a
  downtown, start above the tallest building within 150 m by 100 m or more.
  The build report tells you when you are below a roof.
- The camera is already moving in the direction the flight will keep.
  Do not `hold` on the first waypoint.
- The target is within about ten altitudes. Farther, and the pitch clamps at
  85 degrees and the frame becomes sky.

### Speed

Speed is the first thing viewers feel and the first thing briefs mention.
Set `speed` in m/s whenever the brief says anything about pace, and use
`duration` only when it names a length.

| Brief says | Cruise speed | Ramp | Holds |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| calm, slow, cinematic, night | altitude / 8 | 2000 ms | one or two, up to 2 s |
| nothing about pace | altitude / 5 | 1500 ms | at most one |
| dynamic, fast, energetic, drone racing | altitude / 3 | 800 ms | none |

Altitude is the lowest waypoint altitude on the leg. Per-waypoint `speed`
changes pace mid-flight. A fast pass that slows into an orbit is a stronger
shot than one constant speed.

| Scene | Altitude |
| --- | --- |
| Landmark orbit | 150 to 400 m, radius about 1.5 times the altitude |
| City district | 250 to 600 m |
| Street canyon | 60 to 120 m, over a wide avenue or river only |
| Mountains, coast | 1500 to 4000 m |
| Country, region | 10 to 60 km |

### Motion that feels real

These come from the same rules that make interface motion feel right:

- Constant speed inside a leg, ramps only where speed changes or the camera
  stops. The velocity model does this for you. Do not fake it with extra
  waypoints.
- Nothing pops. The page resolves ground elevation from DEM tiles and
  preloads every tile on the path before frame one, so a long flight waits a
  few seconds longer to start and then never stutters. Do not shorten a
  flight to dodge the wait. The same preload is what makes the recorded
  video smooth.
- Nothing stops dead. A `hold` decelerates over one ramp and accelerates
  out over another. The flight ends with the same deceleration.
- Ease-out, never ease-in. The flight is at full speed on frame one and
  slows into its ending. A flight that starts slow feels sluggish for its
  whole length.
- Asymmetry feels alive. A pass-by that climbs while it pans, an orbit that
  gains 50 m per quarter turn, an approach that slows as it descends.
- Match the personality. A night skyline is slow and level. A sports venue
  is fast with sharp ramps. A national park is high, slow, and wide.
- Reduced motion is respected by the page: it shows frame one and waits for
  Space.

### Flying an existing path

The user may hand you a GPX, KML, TCX, CSV, or GeoJSON LineString: a hike, a
ride, a road trip, a race course. The skill has no importer on purpose. The
waypoint GeoJSON in `references/waypoints.md` is the API; you read the file
and write that format, so any input the model can read is supported and the
skill never grows a parser per format.

- Read the coordinates yourself and note the length. A track has hundreds of
  points; a flight wants 8 to 20 waypoints. Keep the first and the last,
  then keep points spaced evenly by distance, and add one at each real
  change of direction. Drop everything else. GPS jitter becomes wobble if
  you keep it.
- The track is the subject, so use the Tracking move: no `lookAt`, the
  camera looks ahead along the path. A `lookAt` on a summit or a finish
  line is the one exception.
- Altitude is above ground, so a mountain track and a city ride take the
  same numbers. Pick from the scene table: a trail at 150 to 400 m, a road
  trip at 600 to 2000 m.
- Let speed come from `duration` unless the brief says otherwise. A 40 km
  ride in 45 s reads as a helicopter; a 2 km walk in 45 s reads as a drone.
- Tracks recorded on the ground hug the ground. Widen hairpins as the
  report suggests and skip sections that double back.

### Spacing

Space waypoints evenly along the path, so the spline stays smooth. Two
waypoints closer than a fifth of the others make the camera wobble. A turn
sharper than 100 degrees between waypoints overshoots; add a waypoint or
widen the turn. The report flags both.

`lookAt` moves too. Interpolating the target from one landmark to the next
pans the camera. Sliding the target from far to near as the drone descends
tilts it down. A target with altitude, such as a tower top at
`[lng, lat, 300]`, keeps the horizon out of the frame.

## Mistakes to avoid

- A building in front of the lens. Raise the camera or move over open
  ground. Never accept a clearance warning on the first waypoint.
- Ignoring a speed word in the brief. "Dynamic" means altitude / 3 and no
  holds, whatever the default says.
- Holds everywhere. Each stop resets the viewer's attention. One is a beat,
  three is a slideshow.
- Editing `template.html` for one flight. Change the GeoJSON. Change the
  template only when every future flyover needs the change.
- Adding UI. The page has one button by design. Offer more, do not ship it.
- Changing the style or the light preset. The page renders Standard as it
  ships until the flight format grows a place for mood.
